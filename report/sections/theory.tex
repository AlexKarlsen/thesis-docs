\paragraph{\gls{dl}} 

\gls{dl} is a branch of \gls{ml} utilizing \gls{dnn} as the core component to construct complex high accurate models. It has gained popularity, as it achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, such as speech recognition, image classification and natural language processing. The tendency exemplified by the ImageNet Challenge \cite{russakovsky_imagenet_2015} is network are getting deeper. Within a time span of four years the number of layers have grown from 8 to 152 layers. 

The drastic increase in number of layers, have considerably impact on model inference memory consumption and latency, that makes \gls{dnn} infeasible for mobile device. Hence all computationhave been moved to high-end data centers
