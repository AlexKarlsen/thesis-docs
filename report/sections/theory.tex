\section{Edge Computing}

The primary purpose of edge computing reduce latency of real-time applications and improve reliability. Data processing is done in closer proximity to end-users, the shortened communication path leads to a reduction in communication latency. Edge computing seeks to distibute computing resources and data storage in contrast to the last decade centralization of these resources by cloud computing \cite{shi_edge_2016}. Edge computing is envisioned to reliably serve the ever growing number of billions upon billions of connected mobile and \gls{iot} devices. By 2020 Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group, 50 billion things is predicted to be connected to the internet.  As our end-devices keep getting more resourceful and the amount of data generated at the edge is expected to overwhelm cloud data centers and exhaust available bandwidth, edge computing is a possible and necessary step. Furthermore a major concern of cloud computing is the protection of data ensuring data privacy. Edge computing can may address this concern, as no data is expected to leave the network, as all processing is done at the network edge. (Maybe add the push and pull factors of \cite{zhou_edge_2019}) 

Cloud computing have been the de facto standard for \gls{ai} application, as \gls{ai} require tremendous amount of data and computing resources in order to train the self learning algorithms. Real-time applications like \gls{ar}/\gls{vr}, Autonomous Vehicles and Personal Assistant have latency requirements beyond the promises of cloud computing \cite{bibid}. Inference latency can be reduced by moving execution to the edge of the network. Our mobile devices are getting more resourceful and nowadays not uncommon to have a smartphone equipped with a \gls{gpu}. Research ave shown, that the conventional cloud-only approach is actually slower than a mobile-only execution \cite{kang_neurosurgeon:_2017}.

\cite{karlsen_prototyping_nodate} review edge-based offloading and show significant latency improvement by offloading from \gls{cpu}-enabled end devices to \gls{gpu}-enabled edge server.

\gls{cv}, recognition, localization, detection, segmentation

\paragraph{\gls{dl}} 

\gls{dl} is a branch of \gls{ml} utilizing \gls{dnn} as the core component to construct complex high accurate models. It has gained popularity, as it achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, such as speech recognition, image classification and natural language processing. The tendency exemplified by the ImageNet Challenge \cite{russakovsky_imagenet_2015} is network are getting deeper. Within a time span of four years the number of layers have grown from 8 to 152 layers. 

The drastic increase in number of layers, have considerably impact on model inference memory consumption and latency, that makes \gls{dnn} infeasible for mobile device. Hence all computationhave been moved to high-end data centers

\section{Training Settings}

\paragraph{Datasets}

\gls{min100} is a subset of the \gls{ilsvrc2012} dataset \cite{russakovsky_imagenet_2015} created for this project, to reduce training time from several weeks to only days on available hardware. The sub-setting is inspired by MiniImageNet \cite{vinyals_matching_2016}, that uses a subset of 100 classes with 600 samples for each class. \gls{min100} contains 100 out of 1.000 randomly sampled classes, which gives 127.300 out of 1.2m training samples and 5.000 out of 50.000 validation samples. A full list of classes are found in the appendix. 

Compared to other sufficiently dense classification datasets e.g \gls{tinyimagenet} \cite{li_cs231n:_2018}, \gls{cifar10} and \gls{cifar100} \cite{krizhevsky_cifar-10_nodate}, the image sizes of these datasets are respectively $64\times 64$, $32\times 32$, $32\times 32$ pixels, all of which are considered too small  for this project. Other datasets such as MS COCO and Pascal VOC are better suited for object detection/segmentation, as images are not cropped to only focus on a single object, thus too challenging for classification. In fact Pascal VOC was initially tested, the model however, clearly overfitted the training data due to data sparsity. 

\paragraph{Batch Size}

Typically a batch size of 32 is chosen, however smaller batch size, have shown better generalization performance \cite{masters_revisiting_nodate}, thus a batch size of 16 is chosen, which also is maximum to prevent memory exhaustion and still have decent training times. The model is trained on a single \gls{gpu} GTX1080 with 8Gb memory. 

\paragraph{Optimizer}

The weights of \gls{dnn}s are typically trained using a variant of \gls{sgd}. Some more about \gls{sgd} \cite{goodfellow_deep_2016}.

\gls{sgdr} \cite{loshchilov_sgdr:_2016} is a variant of \gls{sgd}, the method have shown faster convergence on a number of datasets, due to its ability to escape local minimas. It follows a cyclic learning rate schedule in contrast to former decaying learning rate schedules. It has shown, in general, to perform better than adaptive optimizers such as Adam \cite{kingma_adam:_2014}, which also implement strategies to avoid being stuck in local minimas. 

\gls{sgdr} uses an aggressive cosine annealing schedule with warm restarts. Figure \ref{fig:cosineannealing} illustrates the learning rate schedule.

\paragraph{Image Augmentation}

A models ability generalize a specific classification problem has a close connection with the number of available training samples. Data augmentation haven proven to be powerful tool in order to virtually create more training data \cite{perez_effectiveness_2017}. Enlarging a training dataset by data augmentation can help create new versions of an image, that are different from but still similar to the original image, without actually having to acquire and annotate new samples \cite{goodfellow_deep_2016}.  

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/augmentation/augmentation_high_resolution.png}
	\caption[Image Augmentaion Example]{Image Augmentation of an elephant}
	\label{fig:augmentation}
\end{figure}

Image augmentation involves transformations using tools from image processing to randomly apply noise injection, and color space transformations including contrast and saturation distortions, as well as geometric transformations, such as simple transformations of flipping the image to more complex affine transformations to create different image perspectives \cite{shorten_survey_2019}. Figure \ref{fig:augmentation} shows 64 random augmentations of an image of an elephant. 

New methods have been proposed where image transformations are learned to improve generalization e.g. AutoAugment \cite{cubuk_autoaugment:_2018}. 

Other methods involves actually enlarging the training dataset by synthetically creating more data using a \gls{gan}. \gls{gan}s can help overcome limited data given the available training data or a 3D model, by artificially constructing new samples in different background, light setting and from alternate perspectives.

Methods that do not cover enriching the available training, but alters the learning procedure are called regularization and covers; weight decay, dropout, batch normalization etc.

\paragraph{Transfer Learning}

Transfer learning are used  to reduce model convergence time and improve model accuracy \cite{yosinski_how_2014}. The network is initialized with weight pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset
