In conclusion, early exit \gls{dnn}s are shown to be a powerful tool to handle the accuracy-latency trade-off important for time-critical applications. Only a small number of samples actually require extremely deep models and can with high confidence exit the model earlier. We show, that models with densely connected layers are more suitable for early exit e.g. \gls{bdensenet} and \gls{msdnet}, as they obtain a higher accuracy for early exits. However the \gls{bresnet} achieves higher reliability on \gls{gpu}-enabled platforms. Even though the early exit of the \gls{bresnet} have the lowest accuracy, it is compensated by a higher end-accuracy with faster runtime i.e. it is able to provide a higher reliability at lower delay thresholds.

Our inference scheme \gls{aee}, is able to improve the reliability under stringent deadlines using early exit \gls{dnn}s. The scheme can be used for both local inference and remote offloading. Offloading for remote inference show improvements over local execution for most models. The adaptability of the scheme handles latency uncertainties from computation and communication delays by best effort. It enables service time-critical applications in time ranges where it is not possible with the conventional \gls{dnn}s. In many \gls{iot} application, the end \gls{iot} devices are not able to run the \gls{dnn}s, therefore edge offloading is a must. The \gls{nuc} used in the experiments is a much more powerful device than normal \gls{iot} device. Our results reveal,that no single setting is always outperforming in all delay conditions. This of course calls for model selection, depending on hardware platforms, connectivity and application deadlines. Our analysis of combining prediction from subsequent exits gave no significant improvements and did show using the deepest available exit is the better option.
