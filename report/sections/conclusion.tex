In conclusion our inference scheme \gls{aee}, is able to improve the reliability under stringent deadline. In fact it enables services for time-budgeted, in time ranges not possible with the conventional \gls{dnn}. The scheme flexibility of the scheme accounts for uncertain computation and communication delays. Our results reveals, that no single setting solves all problems. If deadlines are relaxed, communication and computation latency is low, then the conventional approach outperforms our scheme. This of course calls for model selection, depending on hardware platforms, connectivity and application deadlines.
