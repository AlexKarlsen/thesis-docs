\section{\acrlong{ddnn}}

\gls{ddnn} is an early exit framework proposed by \citet{teerapittayanon_distributed_2017} as their fllow-up on BranchyNet \cite{teerapittayanon_branchynet:_2016} extending the early exit model into a distributed system over cloud, edge and end devices.

This thesis implements the \gls{ddnn} framework, however extending the device model to implement \cite{sandler_mobilenetv2:_2018} and edge model to implement ResNet152 \cite{he_deep_2015} and train on a more complex dataset, Pascal VOC \cite{everingham_pascal_2010}.
