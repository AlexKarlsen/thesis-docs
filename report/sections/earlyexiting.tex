\chapter{Early Exiting}

Early exiting have shown promising result in \cite{teerapittayanon_branchynet:_2016, teerapittayanon_distributed_2017, huang_multi-scale_2017}. Early exiting relies on the assumption, that the majority of samples are easy to classify correctly. \gls{dnn}s have become deeper to accurately classify the more difficult samples.

\gls{branchynet} \cite{teerapittayanon_branchynet:_2016} is framework  for existing \gls{dnn}s, that allow samples, that can be classified earlier to exit the model, hence reducing the latency of computing all layer of the network.
