The objective of this thesis is, taking mobile AR applications as use case, to design and implement of MEC offloading deep learning algorithms to maximize the inference reliability while meeting the service latency deadline. The thesis will design feasible offloading schemes, such as deep neural network partitioning, preprosssing (feature extractions), in objective detection and classification. The proposed schemes will be implemented using Raspberry Pi and Jetson TX2. The communication and computation latency, as well as the inference accuracy and reliability will be measured and analyzed.
