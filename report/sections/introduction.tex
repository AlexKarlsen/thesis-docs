Recent years breakthrough within \gls{dl} have led to a dramatic increase in the amount of \gls{ai} applications and services, such as personal assistants, recommendation systems and surveillance systems. Combined with the development of mobile computing and \gls{iot}, where billions of device are getting connected to the internet. Traditionally data for \gls{ai} applications and services are generated by the devices and transferred to large data centers for computation.    To fully unleash the power of \gls{ai} applications and services \gls{ei} or edge \gls{ai} have become an interesting research area. \gls{ei} have potential to reduce the
