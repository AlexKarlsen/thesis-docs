The emerging applications, such as \gls{ar}/\gls{vr}, autonomous driving, mission critical \gls{iot} applications, and others, require extreme low latency of \gls{ai} decision feedback. The conventional approach is sending the sensor data, e.g., images, to the central cloud or data center to perform advanced \gls{ml} algorithms and send the results, e.g., object detection, classification, back to the end mobile devices. The conventional cloud-centric \gls{ml} framework cannot fulfill the stringent requirements of these emerging applications. \gls{mec} is a new computing paradigm which brings the computing units from the core of the network to the network edge. \gls{mec} has many benefits such as lower communication latency, higher reliability and resiliency, better security and privacy, scalability and context-awareness and others. Pushing \gls{ai} to the Edge is also known as Edge \gls{ai} or \gls{ei}.
